A vital sign of ongoing particle acceleration can be found in the cut-off energy of a supernova remnantâ€™s (SNR) synchrotron radiation spectrum. To determine the cutoff energy and get insight into the nature of particle acceleration at the early stages of SNR evolution, we
carefully studied 10 young SNRs, including all historical SNRs, which allows us to constrain the Bohm factor for each remnant. We are studying the temporal evolution of the acceleration efficiency and how some SNRs are limited by cooling and some by age. Our results reveal a
clear distinction between SNRs limited by age and those limited by cooling. Younger remnants, such as G1.9+0.3, RX J1713.7-3946, and G330.2+1.0, exhibit high cut-off and maximum electron energies, suggesting efficient shock acceleration with minimal effects of synchrotron
cooling. In contrast, older remnants like Tycho, Kepler, and HESS J1731-347 show lower cutoff and synchrotron energies, indicating that synchrotron cooling significantly limits maximum particle energies. Furthermore, remnants such as RX J1713.7-3946, RCW 86, and Vela Jr., with maximum synchrotron energies close to their observed cut-offs, are considered age-limited, although some cooling effects may still be present. Our analysis of acceleration efficiency further suggests that the efficiency remains stable over time, contradicting models proposing linear evolution, with outliers such as SN 1006 showing high efficiency and HESS J1731-347 exhibiting low efficiency. These findings highlight the complexity of cosmic-ray acceleration and emphasize the need for more detailed modeling to
understand the interplay of factors influencing particle acceleration and energy loss mechanisms
in SNRs.
